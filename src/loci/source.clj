  "Connecting an external source to loci: describe it, land it, refresh it.

   The facade, in the sense CLAUDE.md's *one writer, three ways to reach
   storage* means — public, and meant to be called from a REPL attached to the
   live server as well as from the HTTP routes. `describe` **is** the dry run,
   which is why nothing here takes a `:dry-run?` flag.

   `loci.sourcespec` holds the pure half: URI → location, source → SQL."

(defn describe
  "The columns `src` has, and the relation expression that reads them:
   `{:cols [{:raw \"Total Revenue ($)\" :col :total_revenue :type \"BIGINT\"} …]
     :relation \"read_csv('…')\"}`

   One query, doing three jobs at once, which is why materialise and passthrough
   cannot disagree about what the columns are:

   1. **Proof the source reads.** A bad path fails here, not at first render.
   2. **The raw → normalized column map**, through `sub/col-kw`. Both modes
      build their projection from this exact list.
   3. **The schema a preview shows**, before anything is committed.

   Throws with `check-names!`'s ex-data when two headers would become one
   column — the same refusal `normalize-rows` makes for rows."

    ;; and DuckDB answering with a bare parser error.
